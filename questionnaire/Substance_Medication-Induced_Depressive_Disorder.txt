A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.
There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both: (1) the symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to or withdrawal from a medication; and (2) the involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A.
The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Evidence of an independent depressive disorder could include: symptoms preceded the onset of use; symptoms persist for a substantial period (e.g., about 1 month) after cessation of withdrawal or intoxication; or other evidence of non-substance/medication-related depressive episodes.
The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
