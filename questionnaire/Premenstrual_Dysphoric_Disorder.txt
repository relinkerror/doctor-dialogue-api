In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the final week before the onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and become minimal or absent in the week postmenses.
One (or more) of the following core symptoms must be present: marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings; feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection), marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts, marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts, marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge.
One (or more) additional symptoms must be present to reach a total of five when combined with Criterion B: decreased interest in usual activities, subjective difficulty in concentration, lethargy or marked lack of energy, marked change in appetite or specific food cravings, hypersomnia or insomnia, a sense of being overwhelmed or out of control, physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, bloating, or weight gain.
The symptoms in Criteria Aâ€“C must have been met for most menstrual cycles that occurred in the preceding year.
The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or interference with work, school, usual social activities, or relationships with others (e.g., avoidance of social activities; decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).
The disturbance is not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive disorder, or a personality disorder (although it may co-occur with any of these disorders).
Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least two symptomatic cycles. (Note: The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation.)
The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical or neurological condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).
